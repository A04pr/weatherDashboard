This is a 5-day weather forecast application utilizing Jquery, Bootstrap, and the openweathermap 5-day forecast api. 

The application automatically searches for the data for Salt Lake City, providing the user with the wind speed, humidity, temperature, and an icon to represent the weather (ie rain, cloudy, sunny, etc.)

The user may type in the search bar to the left of the forcast and click on the 'search' button to look at the forecast for a different city. 

Each time the user searches for a city a new button will be created with that city's name, serving as a search history. Upon clicking this search history button the user will again search for the city the button is for. 

For example, if the user searches for 'Seattle' a button with the name 'Seattle' will be created under the search bar. If the user clicks this button they will again be presented with the weather data for 'Seattle'.
